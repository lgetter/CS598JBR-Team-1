Then it converts the entire message to uppercase. Finally, it iterates over each character in the message. If the character is a vowel, it replaces it with its corresponding value from `vowels_replace`. If the character is not a vowel, it remains the same. The result is a new string with all vowels replaced by their ASCII character code plus 2 and all other characters converted to uppercase.\n\nThe input 'I DoNt KnOw WhAt tO WrItE' is converted to 'i dOnT kNw whAt tO wRiTe'. The vowels are replaced by 'i', 'o', 'u', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'e'. The ASCII character code plus 2 for each vowel is 'I', 'O', 'U', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'E'.
