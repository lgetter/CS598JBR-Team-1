The lower value is the maximum of 2 and the minimum of the two given numbers, and the upper value is the minimum of 8 and the maximum of the two given numbers. The function then generates a list of even numbers in this range.\n\n                The function is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. It generates the even numbers between the two given numbers, and it correctly handles the case where the given numbers are out of the range [2, 8].\n\n                <start>Correct<end>\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"\n\n                \"\"\"", "is_correct": false}
